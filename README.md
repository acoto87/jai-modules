# Jai modules

These are Jai modules I use in my own projects.

Currently it includes:
* collections: A module with collections commonly used such as lists, stacks and maps.
* fontstash: A light-weight online font texture atlas builder. This is a port from https://github.com/memononen/fontstash.
* nanovg: A small antialiased vector graphics rendering library for OpenGL. This is port from https://github.com/memononen/nanovg.
* stb_truetype: Bindings to the stb_truetype library from https://github.com/nothings/stb.
* utils: A collection of utilities. This may be broken into several other modules later for convenience.
